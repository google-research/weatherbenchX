### Metrics


class CRPSEnsemble(base.PerVariableMetric):
  """Continuous ranked probabilisty score for an ensemble prediction.

  Given ground truth scalar random variable Y, and two iid predictions X, X`,
  the Continuously Ranked Probability Score is defined as
    CRPS = E|X - Y| - 0.5 * E|X - X`|
  where `E` is mathematical expectation, and | ⋅ | is the absolute value. CRPS
  has a unique minimum when X is distributed the same as Y.

  We implement a 'fair' sample-based estimate of CRPS based on 2 or more
  ensemble members. 'Fair' means this is an unbiased estimate of the CRPS
  attained by the underlying predictive distribution from which the ensemble
  members are drawn -- equivalently, the CRPS attained in the limit of an
  infinite ensemble.

  [Zamo & Naveau, 2018] derive two equivalent ways to compute the spread term in
  their fair estimator:

  1. By averaging absolute differences of all pairs of distinct ensemble
  members. This is O(M^2) in compute and memory, but easy to parallelize and
  hence generally cheaper for small-to-medium-sized ensembles. This is
  CRPS_{Fair} in their paper, and is the default implementation here.

  2. By sorting the ensemble members and using their ranks. This is O(M log M)
  and will be more efficient for sufficiently large ensembles. This is
  CRPS_{PWM} in their paper. It can be enabled by setting use_sort=True.

  where `E` is mathematical expectation over X and Y, and | ⋅ | is the absolute
  value. This version of CRPS has a unique minimum, equal to zero, when X is
  distributed the same as Y. This uniqueness holds only for scalar variates. The
  multi-dimensional generalization is the (squared) Energy Distance. See
  [Szekely and Rizzo 2013].

  Using this Metric requires that both forecasts and truth have an ensemble_dim,
  and ensemble size >= 2. The ensemble sizes in forecasts and truth may be
  different.
